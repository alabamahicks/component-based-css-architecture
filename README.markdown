# Component-Based CSS Architecture

> How easily could you update the color scheme or the typography of your site? Can you freely experiment with your site header without fear of breaking something else? Do you know exactly where to find the relevant CSS for any given piece of your interface?

> These questions matter today more than ever. We are often building massive, complex systems that are non-trivial to maintain. Without the right approach, even the simplest change could cause hours of regression testing and debugging.

> I would submit to you that the answer is a component-based architecture. And I’m not alone in that—many people much smarter than I am have suggested this very approach. From SMACSS to Atomic Design and OOCSS to BEM, we see great examples everywhere of people tackling this problem.

> With this demo, you’ll learn about how to organize, name, and build CSS “components” both at a macro and a micro level. It features tools to make everything easier and examples of components in action.
